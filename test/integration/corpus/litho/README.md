# litho corpus

Self-authored conformance fixtures, committed to git rather than downloaded.

Every other corpus comes from a third party and is dominated by files that
exercise one construct at a time. The veraPDF corpus in particular is
single-rule-per-file. That leaves a coverage hole this corpus fills:

> Does a firing rule mask a rule that should also fire?

Each fixture packs many **independent** violation classes into one small file.
If litho short-circuits, latches, or scopes a check too narrowly, the rule set
it reports diverges from veraPDF's and the fixture exposes it.

The fixtures are tiny, self-authored, and carry no third-party licence, so
committing the PDFs is fine. The pikepdf builders in `build/` regenerate them
byte for byte.

## Layout

```
corpus/litho/
├── download.sh     Provisioning step: copies pdfs/ into the output dir
├── manifest.json   Corpus manifest (profile_mode=expand over 8 profiles)
├── build/          pikepdf builders, one per fixture, plus _common.py
├── pdfs/           The committed fixtures
└── README.md       This file
```

`download.sh` downloads nothing. The provisioning image has no Python, so the
Dockerfile bakes `corpus/litho/` in at `/work/litho` and the script copies
`pdfs/*.pdf` into the output directory.

## Regenerating

```bash
cd test/integration/corpus/litho/build
python3 complex_1b.py # rewrites ../pdfs/complex_1b.pdf
```

Builders save with a deterministic `/ID` and `stream_decode_level=none`, so a
rebuild that changes nothing produces an empty diff. The decode level matters:
qpdf's default silently rewrites an `LZWDecode` stream as Flate, which would
delete a planted violation.

## Fixtures

| Fixture             | Home profile | Focus                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `complex_1b.pdf`    | PDF/A-1b     | Part-1 prohibitions: transparency, embedded files, OCG  |
| `complex_2b.pdf`    | PDF/A-2b     | Broadest mix; annotations, optional content, filters    |
| `complex_ua1.pdf`   | PDF/UA-1     | Structure and accessibility defects in a wired tag tree |
| `forbidden_mix.pdf` | PDF/A-2b     | Forbidden actions, PostScript tint transforms, LZW      |
| `megafont_2b.pdf`   | PDF/A-2b     | Font embedding and glyph-width scoping                  |

### Must-not-fire controls

Recent litho fixes added usage-scoping guards whose failure mode is
over-suppression. Each control below is a construct that looks like a
violation but is exempt, so a firing is a false positive.

| Fixture                                   | Control                                                              | Grounding                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `complex_1b`, `complex_2b`, `megafont_2b` | Type3 font `T3B`: skewed `/Widths` on a glyph that is never rendered | width rule is usage-scoped   |
| `complex_2b`                              | Zero-area annotation with no appearance stream                       | ISO 19005-2, 6.3.3 exemption |
| `complex_1b`                              | Fully conforming annotation: `F=4`, `/AP` present, no `/C`           | ISO 19005-1, 6.5.3           |
| `complex_1b`                              | File header pinned to `%PDF-1.4`                                     | ISO 19005-1, 6.1.2           |
| `complex_ua1`                             | `pdfuaid:part=1` present and correct                                 | ISO 14289-1, 5               |

Verified counts at the home profile: `6.2.11.5` fires exactly once on
`complex_2b` (the rendered `T3A` glyph, not the unrendered `T3B` one) on both
litho and veraPDF, and `6.3.3` fires exactly three times, skipping the
zero-area annotation.

## Expected firing sets

Counts are distinct rule classes (`clause/test`) reported by litho. litho and
veraPDF agree exactly on the set in every cell except the one noted below.

| Fixture             | A-1b | A-2a | A-2b | A-2u | A-3b | A-4 | UA-1 | UA-2 |

| `complex_2b.pdf`    | 18   | 23   | 20   | 21   | 22   | 19  | 14   | 12   |
| `complex_ua1.pdf`   | 6    | 7    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 5   | 11   | 9    |

## First bug found: PDF/UA-2 clause-5 masking

On its first sweep this corpus found a litho false negative, and it is exactly
the masking class the fixtures exist to detect.

**`complex_ua1.pdf` at PDF/UA-2.** veraPDF fires `5/2` (`pdfuaid:part` is 1,
not 2) and `5/5` (`pdfuaid:rev` is absent, must be `2024`). litho fired only
`5/2`: `checkPDFUAIdentificationIn` in
`pkg/internal/compliance/accessibility_identification.go` returned on the first
clause-5 failure, so the `pdfuaid:rev` check below it never ran when
`pdfuaid:part` was also wrong. veraPDF evaluates both tests independently
against the same XMP package object. Fixed by accumulating clause-5 violations
instead of returning the first; all 40 cells now agree.

Why no downloaded corpus could catch it: every veraPDF conformance fixture
breaks exactly one rule, so none carries both a wrong `pdfuaid:part` and a
missing `pdfuaid:rev`. Re-running the fix against all 138 PDF/UA-2 corpus files
changes nothing. A single-rule corpus is structurally unable to expose an
early return, which is the whole argument for these fixtures.

## Scope

The runner's `compliance` feature compares verdicts, not rule sets, so this
corpus scores 40/40 matched on verdict alone. The rule-set agreement above is
the property the fixtures actually protect, and it is verified by hand against
a live veraPDF:

```bash
go build -o /tmp/litho ./cmd/litho
/tmp/litho validate pdfs/complex_2b.pdf -profile "PDF/A-2b" -f json
verapdf -f 2b --format json --maxfailuresdisplayed -1 pdfs/complex_2b.pdf
```

Rerun that comparison whenever a compliance rule changes. A new class appearing
on one side only is either a fix or a regression, and this corpus is where it
shows up first.
